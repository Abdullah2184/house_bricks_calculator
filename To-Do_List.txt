Validation rules (contractor-grade, non-negotiable)
These are the minimum validations professionals expect:
Geometry validations
Wall height, width, thickness > 0
Window/door dimensions > 0
Opening area ≤ wall area
Referential integrity
Window/door wall must exist
Wall brick_type must exist
Brick must define rate for wall thickness
Domain validations
bricks_per_m2 must exist for that bond + thickness
mortar_m3_per_1000_bricks > 0
Cement bag size must be positive
Waste factors ∈ [0, 0.25] (realistic upper bound)
Errors should stop execution, not warn and continue.

This will probably require a stack to implement history-management
Parametric “what-if” analysis
"change -o [brick] -id [brick id] -h/w/t/bond [new_value]"
Recalculates (with a copy) and shows difference only on the console for relevant outputs
"rollback [all]" deletes copy
"rollback last"
"change [and so on]" will make further changes (to the copy if not deleted, else create new copy from the original)
"replace" Should update output file as well as input file to maintain consistency

Software won't fail if certain measurements are missing (robust error handling), 
but will not give outputs where the outputs depend on those measurements.

default files for all three input files; but can be overriden by command line arguments
will have a downloadable regional library available on the github repo

implement logging for manual auditing of the calculations
